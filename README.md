Project Summary : 

This project focuses on implementing several pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) in Python, including both cryptographically secure and non-secure generators.

The objective is to evaluate their statistical quality and analyze their security properties through statistical testing and pedagogical attack demonstrations.

The project includes:

Implementation of multiple PRNGs (LCG, MT19937, BBS, DRBG, etc.)

Implementation of statistical tests (Shannon entropy, chi-square, autocorrelation, Kolmogorov-Smirnov)

Demonstration of weaknesses in non-cryptographic generators

Comparative analysis of robustness and security

All algorithms are organized into separate files for modularity and clarity.
A central main.py file is provided to run and test the entire project.
